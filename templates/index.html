      <p>                                                 <b>Chipotle's Success & Business Overview</b>
<br>
Chipotle is a very large restaurant chain by any measure, having grown by leaps and bounds since its founding in 1993. The company owns and operates over 2,700 restaurants, with the vast majority being in the US, but Chipotle has expanded internationally as well to select markets.<br>
The company serves Mexican food with a small menu that is highly customizable by the user, boosting its appeal over chains with fixed menus. Chipotle prides itself on responsibly sourced, sustainable ingredients without artificial preservatives or other processing techniques.<br>
Chipotle has nearly 100,000 employees, produces about $6 billion in annual revenue, and trades with a market capitalization of $35 billion.<br>
Chipotle reported its third quarter earnings on October 21st, with the report being another smasher by a company that is accustomed to huge success. Total revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion during a time when many restaurants are struggling to match last yearâ€™s levels. Comparable sales were responsible for over half of the total revenue gain at 8.3%, with the balance coming from new stores. The company added 44 new stores and closed three during the period, and noted that it still had 10 stores that were closed from COVID-19.<br>
Digital sales grew more than 200% and accounted for almost half of total revenue during the quarter, solidifying the fact that Chipotle is the undisputed leader in the restaurant space when it comes to digital channels. Earnings-per-share fell 1.6% year-over-year to $3.76 as operating margins declined slightly, but overall, investors cheered the report.
